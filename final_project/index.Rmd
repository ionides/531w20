* Projects with source code are posted anonymously on the class webpage.

* Students can request for their name to be added, after the course is over and the class grades are assigned.

* Students can request for projects with confidential data not to be posted.

* In most cases, source code and data are available from [https://github.com/ionides/531w20/tree/master/final_project](https://github.com/ionides/531w20/tree/master/final_project).

* If building on previous source code, note that there are some differences between versions of the software package **pomp**. The [**pomp** version 2 upgrade guide](https://kingaa.github.io/pomp/vignettes/upgrade_guide.html) can be helpful.

* Some projects were recompiled while grading, and may not have been recalculated with full computational effort.
