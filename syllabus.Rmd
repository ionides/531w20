* Course notes are at https://github.com/ionides/531w20

* Supplementary textbook: R. Shumway and D. Stoffer "Time Series Analysis and its Applications" 4th edition. 
A pdf is available using the UM Library's Springer subscription.
An updated pdf is available free from [David Stoffer's website](http://www.stat.pitt.edu/stoffer/tsa4/tsa4.pdf)

* Pre-requisites:
    + Theoretical statistics. STATS 510 or STATS 426 or equivalent. For review, see "Mathematical Statistics and Data Analysis" by J. A. Rice. 
    + Linear algebra. A certain amount of basic linear algebra will be required. For review, see 
[www.sosmath.com/matrix/matrix.html](http://www.sosmath.com/matrix/matrix.html).
    + R programming. There is no formal R prerequisite, but we will be working with R extensively and so you should allow extra time for this course if you are new to R programming. Come to chat and we can make a plan for learning R in the context of your computational background.

## Course outline


1. Introduction to time series analysis.

2. Time series models, trend and autocovariance.

3. Stationarity, white noise, and some basic time series models.

4. Linear time series models and the algebra of autoregressive moving average (ARMA) models.

5. Parameter estimation and model identification for ARMA models.

6. Extending the ARMA model: Seasonality and trend.

7. Introduction to the frequency domain.

8. Smoothing in the time and frequency domains.

9. Introduction to partially observed Markov process models.

10. Statistical methodology for nonlinear partially observed Markov process (POMP) models.

11. Dynamic models and their simulation by Eulerâ€™s method.

12. Practical likelihood-based inference for POMP models.

13. POMP models with covariates, and a case study of polio transmission.

14.  A case study using POMP modeling to study financial volatility.

##  Grading

* Weekly homeworks (20\%).
* A midterm exam (20\%, in class on Thu Feb 20).
* A midterm project analyzing a time series of your choice using methods covered in the first half of the course (20\%, due 5pm on Mon Mar 9). 
* A final project analyzing a time series of your choice using methods covered in the entire course (35\%, due 5pm on Wed Apr 29). 
* Participation (5\%). This will be based on contributions in class and on piazza, or other positive contributions to the class community.
* Course letter grades are anticipated to be mostly in the A, A-, B+ range customary for courses at this level. In the past, this has corresponded to overall scores of approximately 95% for A+, 90% for A, 85% for A-, 75% for B+. However, the exact cutoff used will be determined in the context of the course for this specific semester.

Each homework will have a question asking about sources. You will be asked to explain which parts of your responses above made use of a source, meaning anything or anyone you consulted (including classmates or office hours) to help you write or check your answers. All sources are permitted, but failure to attribute material from a source is plagiarism, which is unethical and may have serious consequences. Directly copied text must be in quotation marks. Directly copied equations must be explicitly referenced to the source. The reader should not have to carry out detective work to figure out correctly which parts of the homework are attributable to a source. Careful attribution of sources is fundamental to good scholarship, and it also facilitates meaningful grading given the reality of abundant sources.

The graders will look for an honest effort applied to the homework, with contributions that go beyond the sources. It is your responsibility to demonstrate to the reader that you have engaged in careful thought related to the questions. If you use sources, you are welcome to comment on what you learned from the sources as a way to show engagement with the questions.

The midterm and final project will also have a substantial grading component allocated to clear and scholarly assignment of credit to sources.
